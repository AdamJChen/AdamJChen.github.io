I'm a civil engineer with a passion for creating sustainable urban spaces. With over a decade of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on some amazing projects that aim to make our cities greener and more efficient.

### A Little About my Journey 🚀:

My engineering journey started at the University of Texas at Austin, where I fell in love with the challenge of solving complex problems. After earning my degree, I moved to California to pursue a master's in Civil Engineering at UC Berkeley, where I specialized in sustainable design.Since then, I've been fortunate enough to work on a variety of projects, from expanding metro systems to designing eco-friendly skyscrapers. One of my favorite projects was the ABC Eco-Tower, a 40-story building that's not only stunning but also LEED Platinum certified for its green features.
