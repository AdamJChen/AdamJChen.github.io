Welcome to my personl website! I'm using this site as a bit of a portfolio for geeky, engineering stuff.

I'm a Master's student in Systems Engineering at the Univeristy of Arizona, and I love intelligent, complex systems that interface with the physical world. I'm an aspiring smart maufacturing engineering, and I'm passionate about the 4th Industrial Revolution.
