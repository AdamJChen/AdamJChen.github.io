Welcome to my personl website! I'm using this site as a bit of a portfolio for my geeky, engineering stuff.

I'm a Master's student in Systems Engineering at the Univeristy of Arizona, and I love intelligent, complex systems that interface with the physical world. I'm an aspiring smart maufacturing engineering, and I'm passionate about the 4th Industrial Revolution.

### A Little About my Journey 🚀:
I began my academic journey studying biology and mathematics at Florida Atlantic University. During my undergraduate career I published two papers, one in neuroscience and another in ecological modeling. This early interest in how natural systems work sparked my curiosity and laid the foundation for my pursuite in systems engineering. After graduating I worked as an Operations Analyst for two years at American Traveler Staffing Professionals where I spearheaded the organization's analytics team. 

My journey took a detour when I became a Buddhist Monk at Bodhinyana Monastery in Perth, Australia. Some of the most fun I had was tinkering in the workshop with the other monks, building sheds, and optimizing the kitchen's operations. Unfortunately, I had some health issues and monastic life was no longer feasible for me. I moved back to the US, and restarted my life here in Tucson. 

### What I Do 🛠️:
Currently, I work for the Office of Scholarship and Financial Aid at the university of Arizona, where I redesign processes and provide technical solutions to improve office operations. This role allows me to combine my passion for problem-solving and efficiency with my technical skills.

### Skills and Tools 💻:
Here a sample of what's in my toolbelt:

**Tools**: Python, Mathlab, Simulink, SQL, AWS

**Skills**:Model Based Systems Enginnering, Simulation, Lean Six Sigma

### What Drives Me 🌎:
We only have one world, so I believe we should take care of it and the beings that live there. I'm deeply passionate about leveraging the Fourth Industrial Revolution to foster equity and sustainability. I believe that advancements in technology and smart systems can play a crucial role in creating fairer, more sustainable societies. I aim to integrate these innovations into manufacturing, ensuring that technological progress benefits everyone.

I also have an insatiable thirst for learning. Whether it's exploring new engineering techniques, staying updated on the latest sustainability practices, or diving into new technologies, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills.

### A little More About Me 🎨:
My favorite Disney memory was not the characters or the rides, but how smoothly the parking operations worked. I have a strange obession for efficient systems, and that carries over into my other love: Long Form, Improvsied Comedy. My favorite format is the Deconstruction because of the philosophy behind it. Position play has really increased the efficiency of my scenes and allowed me to get on to the same page as my scene partners faster. Shout out to Miles Stroth and BOC (Brain James O'Connell) for teaching it to me! Improv has been my way to recharge my creative batteries, and become a better human being. You can typically find me performing at Tucson Improv Movement when I'm not engrossed in my intellectual pursuits.
